# Discussion: Future Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines improvements I would make to the application given additional time. The current implementation includes a NextJS frontend with Tailwind CSS and a Node.js/Express/TypeScript backend using Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL.

## Frontend Improvements

- Add proper aria-labels and keyboard navigation
- Ensure proper color contrast ratios
- Test with screen readers

## Backend Improvements

### Authentication & Authorization
- Implement JWT-based authentication
- Add role-based access control for different user types
- Secure API endpoints with auth middleware

### Testing
- Add unit tests for backend services and controllers
- Implement integration tests for API endpoints
- Add E2E tests with Cypress
- Set up test coverage reporting with a minimum threshold

### Performance Optimization
- Implement caching strategy for frequently accessed data
- Optimize database queries and add indexes
- Set up database connection pooling
- Add rate limiting for API endpoints

## DevOps & Deployment
- Create CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
- Set up staging and production environments
- Implement infrastructure as code using Terraform

## Documentation
- Add comprehensive API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI
- Document database schema and relationships

## Code Quality
